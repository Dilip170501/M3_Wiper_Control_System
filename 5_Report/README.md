## Abstract
Wiper is a fundamental part that used to clear raindrops or any water off of the vehicle's windscreen. The past framework used to enact the wiper physically and the method involved with pulling up the wiper is challenging to be taken care of. Consequently, this framework is proposed to take care of these issues. The goals of this venture are to overhaul the more established vehicles framework by giving programmed cleaning framework, to work on the framework by utilizing sensor with actuator and to plan an essential program that will completely work with the framework. The idea of this proposed wiper framework is comparative with other existing ordinary wiper. As the end for the task, the outcomes shows all the point targets are effectively accomplished. The wiper framework was well practically agreeing the water condition from an external perspective of a vehicle. This undertaking showed a commitment on the plan of the programmed wiper framework for the future exploration in this equivalent field. It is prescribed that the framework to have a concentrate on the wiper material that been utilized to make a wiper on the grounds that the driver at blistering and environment nation are dealing with the issues respects to the wiper material.

## Requirements
### Introduction
A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.

## SWOT:
### Strengths
Agreeable, Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity, Easy transportation

### Weakness
High cost

### Opportunities
It is a Advance System.

### Threat
Need to be Very Careful Using it

## 4W's and 1'H:
### WHO :-
Any client who is going in the vehicle can utilize this framework.

### WHAT :-
Its a Body control model of a vehicle which depicts various elements

### WHEN :-
There is a prerequisite of vehicle these frameworks are utilized

### WHERE:-
Used in Modern And Luxury cars

### HOW :-
By fostering an inserted framework which is easy to understand and can be carried out easily.

## Advantages
Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button!
The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. The metal or hard plastic arms drag a thin rubber (or silicone) blade across the windshield to clear away water, giving you a better view of the road.
Over time, windshield wiper blades crack, tear and lose their flexibility and functionality. Everything from road grit to bird droppings to extreme temperatures to ultraviolet rays contributes to wipers’ breakdown.
So even if you hardly use them, wiper blades still need to be replaced at regular intervals.

## Dis Advantages
Squeaking or chattering sounds when in use 
Skipping motion in the wiper’s movement
Streaking, smears or gaps of moisture on your windshield
Reduced driving visibility, even with the wipers in motion
Cracks, tear or missing pieces of the blade

## Conclusion
As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this field
